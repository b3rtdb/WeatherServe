ABOUT THIS PROJECT
It's a kind of upgrade to my current Arduino's weather station. (Temperature, humidity, Wind speed and direction, rain fall, atmospherical pressure, sun power, luminosity)
I discovered this sensors and its alternative way of measurement on the following web page: https://chrisramsay.co.uk/tag/cloud-detection/

Used in airport, it's traditionally realize with a laser sensor for which the use is strictly regulated. 
The Infrared measurement is a good replacement and completely in accordance with the troposphere constant rule between temperature and altitude. 
I decided to follow Chris's approach and create a full sensor completely compatible with the outdoor conditions. 
That mean:

>water proof => germanium lens = IR transparency < protect the IR sensors

>heating system against ice => heater plug 12V-4W

>clean up system to remove water, ice or snow => waterproof servo to control a deflector

2.IR MLX90614 (FOV90° & 10°) + 1.IR MLX90614 (FOV90°) for reference compensation due to the Ge Lens + Complete 3D printing body.

In the following pix we could see the main body with the two sensors head with a copper bridge to defrost the Germanium lens. 
The part is the waterproof servo Hitec. 
A second MLX90614 is externalized without heating and without additional lens to assume a compensation and re adjust the altitude.



Tests are running. Heater is running very well and the safety loop also. 
Bodys are printed with PLA, so they are not really compatible with high temperature. 
The Heater can overeats 150°C under 12V, this why I decided to split the power supply level (aligned with the servo's needs) and define a safe threshold at 55°C.

_______________________First Tests and result 19&20 January 2019_______________________

24hr outdoor. I placed it outdoor with a full blue sky so that should provide the lower temperature and by conversion the biggest altitude close. 
This the main facts:

>I created a new control cover , higher to handle the Mega board because it was initially design to a Uno version

>Heater is running very well but high temperature on germanium lens create abnormal deviation to check the object temp.
	=> program command has been changed to reduce this and maintain a lower temp and reduce the deviation.

>I tested rubber blades, but I should reduce the rotation speed.
	=> even if the design on the Head and the Ref sensor casing have been designed to provide a nice slope, the 'shock' seem too strong and the blades extracted from the deflector.

>there are still glitches on measurement. I think my wiring is guilty because too 'wild' I placed a photo below
	=> it's decided I'm going to use Eagle to create my own PCB, and probably replace the Darlington transistors to Finder relays.

>Results sounds good in appearance. The high altitude should be better if the sensor can be place over the roof.
	=> during this phase I placed it on my terrasse and the 90° angle integrate a part of the house... that create an offset of temperature. 
	   A part of the recording was also disturb by c... blades are not in place on the deflector, but there were no ice at the morning.
	   that sound really good.
