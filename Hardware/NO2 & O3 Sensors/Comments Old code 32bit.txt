Some comments regarding the code
The DGS-H2S 968-036 operating manual of the sensor (version March 2017) is a bit ambiguous regarding the UART communication protocol. On page 5 it states that a command is recognized if it’s received within 1-second from a TRIGGER event. On the next page, we find a 5-seconds interval for a command to be recognized.

I have found that the commands are recognized within an 800-milliseconds interval after the trigger event (before the sensor starts sending back the measured values). As a result, configuring the sensor with a terminal program such TeraTerm is next to impossible.

Also, the commands must NOT be terminated with \r\n or with \n, Just the command letter is enough.

Code examples for other commands will be published soon,

When starting for the first time, you will get some extreme readings. This is because the way this sensor works. In one of the technical documents, I have found a piece of information that compares this sensor with a capacitor, with bias placed across the working and reference electrodes being similar to the voltage across the plates of a capacitor. The high current observed at the sensor startup is like the charging current of a capacitor. As such, it is recommended to leave the sensor run for about one hour after power-up to get accurate readings.
